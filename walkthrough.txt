Walkthrough: Gemini 2.0 Flash Integrations
I have successfully injected 3 specific Gemini 2.0 Flash features into your portfolio to make it "award-winning" for the "New Year, New You" challenge. These features showcase multimodality, extreme low latency, and adaptive AI for constrained environments.

Features:
Uses Gemini 2.0 Flash for near-instant responses.
Pre-seeded with your "Constraint-First" philosophy and project history.
Adaptive: Changes its system instructions and greeting based on the simulated network speed.
2. Crop Advisor Interactive Vision Demo
Transformed the Crop Advisor project from a static description into a live multimodal demonstration.
